# Crimson Accord Character Sheets

This project is aimed at generating LARP character sheets for hybrid games, where existing WhiteWolf(tm) or D&D character sheet programs don't really fit the bill.

This code is still a work in progress, so full functionality, documentation, and examples are not yet available.
